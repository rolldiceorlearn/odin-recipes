            The cod serenade is one of the Puerto Rican foods that I like the most; It is fresh, complete, easy to prepare and very rich, 
            I also love the romantic name. It seems to me that this dish sums up this convergence of cultures here on the island: on the 
            one hand, ingredients such as cod and olive oil of Spanish heritage, and on the other, root vegetables, a staple food of the 
            Taínos and Africans. In restaurants you can get it on the menu on Friday specials; I imagine that because it is a very Lent 
            and Easter dish, then it has been left to consume on Fridays throughout the year, I don't know, my ideas.</p>

        <li>2 tablespoons white vinegar or white wine</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic</li>
        <li>pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Parsley or coriander to taste</li>
     </ul>    
         For the accompaniments:
         <ul>
            <li>2 yauties</li> 
            <li>3 green bananas (bananas, cambur)</li>
            <li>1-2 yellow sweet potatoes</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>Avocado</li> 
            <li>olive oil to serve</li>
         </ul>    
     <b>Instructions</b>
     <ol>
     <li>Desalt the cod: wash the fillets well to remove the salt that 
        covers them. Place them in a container with water, let soak for 
        about 6 to 8 hours, changing the water approximately every two hours.
         Once this time has passed, place the cod with fresh water in a pot and 
         let it cook for about 15 minutes or until it breaks the boil, drain the
          water. Taste a piece of the fish to verify that it has desalted to 
          your liking, if it seems to you that it is still salty, repeat the 
          boiling with fresh water. Let cool and crumble (check that it does 
          not have any thorn).</li>
     <li>Prepare the vegetables: Cut the onion and bell peppers into julienne strips, 
        the tomato into small pieces and the cut or grated cabbage, pass it through hot 
        water to soften it, you can use lettuce instead.</li>
     <li>Make the vinaigrette: In a bowl, mix the olive oil, vinegar, the crushed clove 
        of garlic and pepper (I didn't add salt because the cod already has the flavor I 
        like, if you want you can add salt), mix with a whisk to that emulsifies.</li>
     <li>Once it’s cooled, break the salt cod into big flakes and place in a bowl.</li>
     <li>MCombine cod and vinaigrette: in a glass container place the desalted and shredded 
        cod and the vegetables, add the vinaigrette, chopped parsley or coriander and mix 
        well to integrate everything. Cover and let marinate for at least 1 hour in the fridge 
        (I do it overnight).</li>
     <li>Cook the viands: peel the yautías, sweet potatoes and bananas, cut the first two
        into pieces, cook in salted water, you can do it separately as was my case or cook 
        them all together, cook the eggs for 9 to 10 minutes from the moment that breaks the boil. </li>
     <li>To serve: place a portion of the cod salad on a plate, arrange the root vegetables, a few pieces of 
        avocado and boiled egg to taste, add olive oil over all the ingredients, sprinkle with a 
        little parsley or cilantro. Enjoy.</li>
    </ol>
   <b>Grades:</b> 
    <ol>
        <li>In the step of boiling the cod, I did it twice to remove as much salt as possible, 
            besides I did not add salt to the vinaigrette, for my taste it turned out well that 
            way for the time of the marinade it took on a very good flavor without the need to 
            add more salt.</li>
        <li>The yellow sweet potato darkens at the same moment of starting to remove the skin, as
             I peeled and chopped it I submerged it in water with a little vinegar and cooked it in 
             water with a splash of milk, something helped that it was not so dark at the end.</li>
        <li> The salad lasts well for several days in the fridge, for that reason I do not like to 
            combine all the elements of the dish until the moment of serving so that it is better preserved.</li>
        <li>You can serve the salad on a bed of lettuce .</li>
       </ol>
