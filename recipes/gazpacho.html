    <center><h3>Gazpacho (Puerto Rican Salt Cod Salad)</h3></center>
    <center>
        <p style="border:3px; border-style:solid; border-color:#525252; padding: 5em;">
        Puerto Rican gazpacho features salt cod, known Bacalao 
        (pronounced [bah-kah-LAH-oh]). Bacalao is the Spanish term for 
        dried and salted codfish. After the fish has been cleaned and 
        eviscerated, it is salted and dried. It’s then sold whole or in 
        fillets, with or without the bone. Before consuming it, the fish 
        needs to be rehydrated and the excessive amount of sodium reduced 
        by soaking and changing the water several times over many hours.
        Once the salt has been removed from the cod, it’s boiled until 
        tender, cooled, and combined with fresh tomatoes, white onion, 
        ripe avocadoes, olive oil, and a splash of vinegar. This dish is 
        super simple, yet packed with flavor. </p>
